        </div>

          <p className="reflection-paragraph">
            When I first entered college, I thought the most important thing was academic excellence. 
            I buried myself in lectures, deadlines, and reviews, always striving to excel in exams. 
            But while I was gaining knowledge, I was losing something just as important—my health.
          </p>

          <p className="reflection-paragraph">
            I didn't notice it at first. It started with fatigue, sore muscles after even the simplest tasks, 
            and a general feeling of weakness, especially in my arms and legs. I had no regular physical activity. 
            I didn't care about posture, endurance, or muscle strength. Slowly, I became disconnected from my own body.
          </p>

          <p className="reflection-paragraph">
            I felt insecure about how I looked and even more about what I couldn't do. I avoided tasks that 
            required physical effort because I was ashamed of how weak I had become. Clothes no longer fit 
            the way I wanted them to. I hid my body—and in many ways, I hid myself.
          </p>

          <p className="reflection-paragraph highlight">
            That was when I realized: I needed change—not just physically, but mentally and emotionally too.
          </p>

          <p className="reflection-paragraph">
            I began my fitness journey with small steps: home workouts, simple routines, and building discipline 
            through consistency. I also practiced intermittent fasting (16:8) to regulate my eating habits and 
            improve my metabolism. It wasn't easy. There were days I felt like quitting. But PATHFIT helped me 
            understand the importance of holistic health—not just looking fit, but being well in body, mind, and spirit.
          </p>

          <p className="reflection-paragraph">
            Through the course, I learned how physical activity improves not only strength and endurance but also 
            mental health. I began to feel more confident. The endorphins released from exercise helped reduce 
            the anxiety I often carried. I wasn't just building muscle—I was building self-worth.
          </p>

          <p className="reflection-paragraph highlight">
            PATHFIT taught me how movement is not a punishment for my body, but a way to honor it. That health 
            is not about perfection, but about showing up for yourself—even on the hard days.
          </p>

          <p className="reflection-paragraph">
            Now, I feel stronger, healthier, and more in control. I can lift more, last longer during workouts, 
            and most importantly, I don't feel fragile anymore. My body is no longer something I avoid—it's 
            something I'm proud of.
          </p>

          <p className="reflection-paragraph">
            This journey has shown me that fitness isn't a destination—it's a lifelong commitment to yourself. 
            And through PATHFIT, I've gained the tools, the mindset, and the courage to keep going.
          </p>

          <p className="reflection-paragraph highlight">
            To anyone who feels insecure or behind—know this: you can start at zero and still build something 
            incredible. Because strength isn't about where you begin, but about the decision to begin at all.
